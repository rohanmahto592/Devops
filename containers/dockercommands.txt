How to share the image
 suppose you have ubuntu and you made changes by adding a file and you want to share that file
 process
 docker run -it ubuntu
 touch rohan.txt
 echo "i m rohan" >>rohan.txt
 docker commit -m "message" "previous_image_id" "new_image_name"
 This will create a copy of the image with all the files and changes.

how to create your own docker image
login to docker hub through cmd using
- docker login with username and password
- create dockerfile with "touch Dockerfile"
- open in write mode using vim command and add the base image starting with "FROM xyz" 
- then add all the dependencies
- CMD ["echo","heello rohan"], this command get executed after the docker image is executed.
- save the changes
- execute the command by [docker build -t "new_image_name"]
when you execute this command , it will build along with the directory it is in. ***important

Always create a main directory and inside which create a docker image then execute the build command.


docker run command will build a container which is a running instance of an image.
to build an image, we can use a docker build command which will build an image containg all the instructions.(docker build -t imagename)
